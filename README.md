This package is an extends the functionality of PowerModels.jl by providing of the AC-Optimal Power Flow Problem as quadratic and quartic polynomial optimization problems using DynamicPolynomials.jl. Several polynomial stregthenings based on SumOfSquares.jl are provided to compute lower bounds to the AC-OPF.
